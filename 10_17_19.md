# Morning 
I woke up late. I want to work on setting a schedule that has me rising everyday at 6am. To do that, I need to be in bed by 10pm. On days that I work, I need to call it a night at 9pm in order to make it to 10pm bedtime. My goal will be to be in bed with wifi off by 10pm for 30 days.

## Daily Goals
- 4 hours of kotlin tutorial and finish 3 videos
- 2 hours of leetcode and finish 1 problem/setup 1 problem
