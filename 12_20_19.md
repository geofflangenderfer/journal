# Morning
feels good to get the job at UT coding bootcamp. It reduces some uncertainty with a bit of guaranteed income, althogh I need to prepare myself to deliver value to the students.

My goal is to get 2 linkedin recommendations from students I teach. In order to do that, I need to make a lasting impression on them over the 6 month course. I can do that by helping them get the most out of the course and showing them how to move past roadblocks. I'll be able to do that if I've mastered the material they'll be covering:

- react frontend
- python backend 
- mongodb/postgresql

# Goals
- watch 3 videos
# Completed
# Recap
