day 1 of 100 hour week. Feeling excited. I respond well to challenges. And, I
haven't had one in a while. I'm looking forward to see what I'm made of.

14 hours today means studying til 10pm. I think I can do it.

I'll attempt without caffeine. I slept rough last night. I ate too late and had
caffeine. I'll try to finish eating by 7pm.

Putting in 100 hours will benefit me greatly. I think I can get through 50
leetcode problems.
