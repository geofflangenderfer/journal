# Morning
## Feelings Debug
I'm feeling anxious and ashamed of my lack of progress. I feel unready for a potential interview as a full-stack developer.

I feel like I'm unproductive because I get up late and waste time on my phone. 


# Goals

## Yearly
It's been a while since I made some significant progress. My goals are:
- $10k/month from consulting revenue or a software product 

If my goal is consulting, the next step would be to delve into kotlin/swift. If it's product, the next is reducing my MVP iteration speed with javascript.  
I'm going to stick with javascript for now. I need to make it work. 

## Today
- 1 testing video
- read redux typescript codebase 
- bed by midnight
