# Morning
## Feelings Debug
I feel frustrated that I didn't get 8 hours of sleep after squatting. I usually sleep really well on these days. I did eat late, which may have affected me. I'll try to push my last meal earlier in the evening 

I'm making slow progress on gigMax, but I'm a bit anxious that it's not going faster. 

I also haven't made much progress on algos/ds, which is also making me anxious. I would prefer to win the app contest and fail the algos/ds portion than win neither, so I'll focus on the app and give algos/ds the remaining time.

# Recap
First time I can remember completing all my goals in a day! 

Even though I'm writing shitty code currently, it's still best for my improvement because what not to do will be ingrained in me. This trial/error should be balanced with reading experienced folks accounts of what to do.

I felt so good after working out, it's easily worth the $35/month it will cost me. I could knock that cost out with +4 days of work
