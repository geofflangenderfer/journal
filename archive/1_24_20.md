# Morning
## Feelings Debug
I'm feeling pretty good after sleeping well and showering in the morning. Showering is new, but it definitely feels good.

I feel anxious about a lack of progress with gigMax. Gonna double down and get shit done today. 


# Goals
# Completed
- made progress on setting up dev environment in Windows WSL
# Recap
I procrastinated on something valuable, but it was a distraction from gigMax, which can have the greatest impact. Everything else is secondary from now on.
