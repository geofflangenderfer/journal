# Morning
## Feelings Debug
I'm feeling better after doing yoga. 

Today I want to work on gigMax and am dreading grading. I'm which I should work on first. I'll try what I want and look to flip that in the future to get a decent experiment running.

# Goals
- refactor so stripBom fits
- finish up mutate.ts
- finish grading with new rubric
# Completed
- finish grading with new rubric
