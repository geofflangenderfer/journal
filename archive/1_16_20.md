# Morning
TripScraper.js LOC: 154
## Feelings Debug
I'm feeling unpleasant. Maybe from lack of sleep. I will focus on bed by midnight today.

I'm feeling ok about my app.

Feeling anxious about coding bootcamp. I will operate as if 50% chance it falls through.

# Recap
I got much less done today than I hoped. I hit a roadblock with gigMax and was ready to switch to interview prep, but I got sidetracked. The cue for that was intellectual uncomfortable state after being stumped. 

cue: intellectual roadblock/discomfort
effect: seek comfort on youtube

I can attempt to notice these uncomfortable states and try to substitute something for the unwanted behavior:
- brew a coffee and take an untimed break
- go for a walk
- go to the gym


I'm frustrated with progress on gigMax. For a feature stack rank, in descending importance:
- earnings dashboard: easy to build and validates that couriers are interested in this information.
  - finish data processing 
  - store into db
  - data request queries
  - display on react frontend
  - login
- blog article explaining how I use data to maximize hourly
