## Feelings Debug
I'm feeling anxious about lack of progress on gigMax. I'll redouble my efforts today.

I'm feeling excited by the challenge of gigMax also. It's an opportunity for me to shine.

# Recap
I'm having trouble starting. Once I get going, I can continue. So, I need to work on starting. Some ideas:
- begin the day with 20 minute pomodoro
- 20 min pomodoro and no daily hour goal
- going over my why

I'll start with pomodoro + daily goal
