# Morning
## Feelings Debug
I'm disappointed that progress on gigMax is stalling. Here are some thoughts on how to kickstart things:
- start the day with a 20-minute pomodoro and no other goals
- recite my why: why am I spending so much time on this? Where do I hope to be as a result?

Here's my why: I want to build a family. When I die, I want people to be sad for the loss in their lives. I want to have impacted people in that manner. That only comes from a life of building and sharing. 

If I were to die today, no one would notice. I need to work to change that reality.
