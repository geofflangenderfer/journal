# Recap
I'm not getting the results that I want: making progress towards $10k/month from software consulting or $10k MRR software product. That means I need to change up my habits:
- schedule every minute of my day until my birthday
- 12 hrs/week food delivery
- 35 hrs/week coding; 350 lines/week
- bed by midnight; wakeup 7am
- only buy food at HEB/trader joes
- journal 2x/day
  - account of daily goals
  - make next days goals
