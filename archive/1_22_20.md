# Morning
## Feelings Debug
I'm a bit frustrated that this is the first journal and I haven't gotten much coding done this week. Winning the app contest is very important to me, so I need to give it special care. I will strictly follow my schedule until it's over:
- 11pm: wifi off
- 12pm: lights out
- 8am: wakeup
- 8-8:30am: morning routine/meditate
