# Morning
I took some time to apply to some server jobs this morning. My thinking is I want to have at least $5,000 as a buffer and to reduce anxiety. It's getting cold and I don't know how much longer I'll be able to deliver food. Ideally, I would get the online english teacher job, which I can do from anywhere.

I'm coming to realize the fastest way to $10,000/month from software development is to have a FANG on my resume, which is why I'm devoting time to leetcode. 

Slow start to the day, but I can always do my best with the time remaining 

## Daily Goals
- 1 context API tutorial video
- 1 leetcode problem
- 4 hours deep work
- 10pm bedtime  

## Results
- 0 tutorial videos
- 0 leetcode
- 3 hours deep work

# Reflection
still not getting the results I want, mainly because of procrastination. I'm going to focus on that.
