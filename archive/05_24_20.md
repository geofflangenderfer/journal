I like the idea of consistent free-form writing. It will help me get my
anxieties on the page and develop new ideas. I'm thinking about my youtube video
and the amazon interview. Can I do both? Should I focus on one over the other?
I believe both are possible with planning.

For 'How to make money on a bicycle', here's what I want to include:
- how much can you make?
  - my goal was $600 to start iOS app development
  - I made $17/hr over 30 hours
  - I mainly worked Fr-Su
- how can I get started?
  - sign up to a food-delivery platform
  - buy a bike
  - buy a phone
- how can I maximize earnings? (reduce uncertainty. Create a feel-good experience)
  - fill Fr-Su 6-9pm hours first. Then, 6-9pm on other days
  - text the customer an ETA when you leave restaurant
  - On arrival, ask if the customer would like to double-check their order
    - once I had to return to a restaurant. I didn't complain. I received a
      generous tip.
