Trying to get back to journalling. My thoughts are scattered. This helps smooth
them out.

I haven't been making the progress I like. Here are some causes:
- fixated on social media
- no fixed routine. I haven't built up secondary habits that reinforce practicing coding problems.
- my why is scattered. It needs to be more concrete. I need to lay out a can't
  lose plan.
  - family
  - enough stability to get me to ramen-profitable

I'd like to explore each of these further. I'll sit on them for now and work on
rebuilding habits.
