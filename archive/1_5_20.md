# Morning
Days til app submission: 46
## Feelings Debug
I'm feeling a bit down about staying up late last night and getting up late today. I think part of the trigger to stay up late is eating late, so I'm banning eating after 10pm. 

I'm feeling depressed about my acne. I wonder whether people can see it when they look at me. I need to do diet/sleep/exercise experimentation to see if I can find something that limits this.

I'm feeling down about my hygiene. I know I smell terrible, and I feel embarassed that others might smell me. I'm going to showering after physical activity a standard.

I'm feeling down about not doing all that I can to work towards my software goals. I'll fix this buy coming up with a plan of daily activity that will lead to my eventual success.
