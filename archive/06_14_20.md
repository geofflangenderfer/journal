I'm a bit anxious about new, inconsiderate roommates. I need to focus on what I
can control. Adjust my expectations.

I don't like being around dumb, unambitious people. I don't like perspicuously
ambitious people either. I prefer the ambitious because they push me to be better.
I've gone a long time around lazy people. I'm ready for the alternative.

Could that be a digital nomad hub in SA? Bali?
