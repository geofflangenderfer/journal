# Morning
I haven't been getting much done lately. Gambling on stocks has forced me to spend time earning money in pointless jobs instead of using that time for coding. I'm also addicted to sugar. I need to focus on my goals and be relentless in analyzing whether each daily decision is moving me closer or further from them.

## Daily Goals
- 3 practice runs for english teaching interview
- smash retail interview at noon
- meditate/drink water as food cravings grow stronger
- bed by 10pm
