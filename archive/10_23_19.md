# Morning
Got a good nights sleep and went to bed on time. I'm curious to see how this affects my distraction throughout the day. I'm focusing on procrastination redirectes and finishing the search page

## Daily Goals
- 3 procrastination redirects (meditaiton, write a plan)
- get something for search view
- 1 leetcode problem
- 6 hours deep work
- 10pm bedtime 
- read 1 chapter 
- 4 deliveries

## Results
- 3 proc. redirects
- 1/2 leetcode
- 6 hrs deep work
- 1/2 chapter
- 7 deliveries
- 10:30pm bedtime

I got a decent amount done; I also got a good nights rest. I'm going to keep focusing on the bedtime.
