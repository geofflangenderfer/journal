# Morning
## Feelings Debug
I'm a bit anxious that I'm participating in a scam. The bootcamp is not going to produce valuable employees businesses will hire. 

I'm anxious at my stagnant progress with gigMax. If I don't move the needle this week, here are things I will try next week:
- daily 20 min meditation on wakeup
- no goals beyond 20 min pomodoro to start the day
- rewrite it
