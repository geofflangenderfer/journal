# Morning
I'm feeling good after going to bed around 10pm for the 2nd night. I'll keep my bedtime as a priority. Focusing on procrastination redirects also hlped me to focus on when I started to procrastinate: I believe it helped reduce the time lost. 

For React, I want to continue learning from various sources, but the only way it will stick is when I implement something myself, starting easy. 

## Daily Goals
- 10pm bedtime
- 3 procrastination redirects
- 8 hours deep work
- implement toy example of Context API
- 1 leetcode problem
- 5 deliveries 

## Results
- 2 redirects
- 2 hrs deep work
- 4 deliveries

# Recap
More distracted than I'd like. The rent thing is making it hard to concentrate, although I think I have a plan to make what I need before the deadline. Working that out should reduce that as a distraction. My goal is to do 4 hours deep work in one sitting. Twice what I did today.
