First day of dictating didn't go as well as I needed. I will be gritting my
teeth today. You've got this buddy. Why are we doing this? To make family proud.
To make myself proud. To gain security. Recognition. jump-start funds needed for
starting a business. Hone my software engineering skills. Gain an environment of
successful people.
