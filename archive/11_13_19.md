# Morning
My daily habits are not in a good place. I'm going to try to get them back a little at a time. 


## Daily Goals
- meditate 3x for 20 minutes
- 1 chapter EJS
- draw views for todoDone

## Results
- meditate 1x

# Recap
I didn't get much done, but I felt great after the meditation session. I will make that a priority. I will not miss a day. I'm going to go with javascript. No more distractions from kotlin until I have a job.
