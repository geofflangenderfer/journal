# Morning
## Feelings Debug
I'm feeling motivated to get work done. I know this won't always be the case, and I need to think about how to get things done when I'm not motivated. 

One thing is to focus on my why. I want to build something that I can be proud of. When I die, I want people to be affected like they were with Kobe.
