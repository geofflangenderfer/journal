# Morning
Steadily improving on wakeup hour and overall sleep. More work to do.

I want to focus on 3 strategies for combatting procrastination:
- meditate 10-20min
- take a walk
- switch tasks

I'm feeling anxious about my progress towards my job goals. I believe it comes from not being clear on a plan to accomplish them and not executing well enough. Another thought is that I have the plan, but I've failed to execute by putting in the grind hours. The execution is more important because it will give valuable feedback on how to pivot my plan. 


# Goals
- 1+ procrastination redirect
- 2.5 hours coding
- bed by midnight
