# Morning
## Feelings Debug
feeling a bit sad about hearing about kobe's death. He showed me what was possible if you make no excuses and give everything. I tried to emulate that, unsuccessfully, haha. But he showed me it was possible. I've carried that to other areas of life too. I'm going to take what I learned from him and run with it. 

In terms of becoming a SWE, there is no failure. I can't fathom it. I'd rather be dead. Now assuming I'm the best SWE, how do I work back from that point? 

I'm going to do something that will make me and Kobe proud.
