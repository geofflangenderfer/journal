I want to take on a challenge of 5 hours of study everyday til the end of the year and document it on my blog. There are 335 days remaining, so that means 1675 hours of study. Benefits:
- overcoming this challenge will increase my confidence in self
- I know I produce more when challenged beyond current skill levels
- level up skills to produce value that justifies $8,333/month in software consulting/product revenue
- anecdotal evidence for those that follow. I envision another newbie stumbling onto this diary and being inspired that they can do it too. 

What you can expect from following:
- daily updates on: hours worked, progress made
- monthly updates on: profit/loss report
- random thoughts relevant to the software developer strivers
# Goals
- 5 hours study
