# Morning
## Feelings Debug
I'm feeling anxious after checking youtube/linkedin non-stop after posting a video. I get a rush whenever I see the #s increase. I don't think this is healthy. 

A better approach would be to not care about likes, simply make something for an audience of 1, me. Then compress multiple status checks to a few with automation. 

I'm a bit frustrated at my lack of focus. Time to get back on the wagon.
