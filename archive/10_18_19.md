# Morning
I feel good today. I got up early and am ready to start the day. I'm going to be more aware today if I'm in the moment and being productive. I've got a plan of action when I recognize myself procrastinating:
- write out a plan of action
- meditate
- take a nap
- get back to work

## Daily Goals
- 1.5 kotlin tutorials
- 2 leetcode problems
- 6 hours of deep work (try to pause timer when I'm not working)

# Daily Recap
- 0 kotlin tutorials
- 1/2 leetcode problem
- 3.75 hours deep work

I got much less done than expected, but I also didn't account for cutting work at 4pm to eat and head to work. It could have been worse, but also much better. 

I hope the actual results will improve as I get better with time. For now, I can only focus on the process and deep work. I'll lower my real results expectations and be hyper-diligent about being aware in the moment. Then, I'll check back in a couple weeks to see the progress on actual, real daily results.
