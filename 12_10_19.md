# Morning
Still slow to get started in the morning. I got distracted by my phone. The solution is no internet on phone til days work completed. 

Ali said I've turned bitter and mad. I'm not sure if this is true, but it may be. As a precaution, I'll double my efforts towards tending my mental garden:
- meditation daily
- regular physical exercise outside of food delivery (yoga, gym)
- strict diet: no sugar added, no dairy, no paying for prepared food
# Goals

- 4 hours work done
- 1 chapter clean code
