# Daily Recap
## Goals
I didn't complete as much as I planned this morning. I need to cut down on procrastination. I also think checking in more often with the daily goals throughout the day will help me realize if I'm off track. 

### $10,000/month software development
- I worked on kotlin today, which should help me differentiate myself from crowded frontend market. 
- I started work on a leetcode problem. I need to get through 200 problems to be competitive in interviews, so I have a long way to go here.

### $10,000 MRR software product
- I'm registered for the alexa skills hackathon, and I have a few ideas for apps to make. I'm really excited about this because I'll gain great experience shipping this app.
