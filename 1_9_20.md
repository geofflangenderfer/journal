# Morning
## Feelings Debug
I feel frustrated that I didn't get 8 hours of sleep after squatting. I usually sleep really well on these days. I did eat late, which may have affected me. I'll try to push my last meal earlier in the evening 

I'm making slow progress on gigMax, but I'm a bit anxious that it's not going faster. 

I also haven't made much progress on algos/ds, which is also making me anxious. I would prefer to win the app contest and fail the algos/ds portion than win neither, so I'll focus on the app and give algos/ds the remaining time.
