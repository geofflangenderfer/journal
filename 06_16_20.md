I'm anxious about the french, but I can reframe:
- opportunity to practice gaining compliance: commitment + consistency,
  consistency, "because", "how to win friends and influence people"

I'm thinking about areas I could potentially amass a 1 million instagram
following in:
- fitness
- health/wealth combo -> more differentiation
  - the healthy software engineer
- health on a budget
- health + wealth on a budget: help people build health and wealth on a budget
  - 3 month home body transformation
    - intro: get these results!
    - M/W upperbody workout
    - T/Th lowerbody workout
  - Amazon SWE: 3 year overnight success
    - leetcode solutions
    - app tutorial
    - pomodoro time studied progressive overload
