I looked at pictures of Megan. I feel sick to my stomach. Shame for losing what
seems so valuable. I feel sad. One approach would be to hold onto these feelings
and try to use them as motivation kindling. Another is to let them pass, as all
feelings do.

My inner voice is not wrong for being sad. She was great. I learned a lot from
my time with her. But, you must move on when you reach a plateau: with a
relationship, job, or other time/energy-costly activity.


Can I let the feelings pass and harness them for motivation? I don't think so.
If i'm conjuring these negative emotions for motivation, I'm not letting them
pass.

I'm not sure which approach works best or the results, so I could run an
experiment:
- two treatments: 15 Megan minutes, 30 meditation minutes
- for each treatment:
  - perform at beginning of day
  - track deep work
  - track emotional state
