# Recap
I got nothing done. I watched tv. That's ok, but it should be planned in advance. I'm not feeling the urgency, but I should. 
- I'm getting older and won't be able to deliver food the rest of my life
- natalie and my mom are walking money pits
- jonah earns nothing
- paul will not be there to help

If there's some kind of emergency, we're screwed. The play is to aim for FANG. I can continue my business pursuits on the side, like clement did. This also exposes me to high-value potential customers. That market is more competitive, but I will need less market share to make an impact.
