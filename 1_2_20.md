# Morning
## Feelings Debug
I'm feeling anxious and ashamed of my lack of progress. I feel unready for a potential interview a a full-stack developer.
# Goals
## Yearly
It's been a while since I made some significant progress. My goals are:
- $10k/month from consulting revenue or a software product 

If my goal is consulting, the next step would be to delve into kotlin/swift. If it's product, the next is reducing my MVP iteration speed with javascript.  
I'm going to stick with javascript for now. If I don't make meaningful progress soon, I'll switch. (gotta think about this??)
