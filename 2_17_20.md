# Morning
## Feelings Debug
I'm feeling anxious about 2/20 deadline for gigMax. If I finish grading today, and grind the next two days, I might be able to put something together. 

I'll spend 1 hour on automation. If not working, I'll switch to manual.

Time to see what I'm made of. 3 days to get something working. Let's go!
# Goals
- finish grading 
- ship mutate.ts
- think about what views I want to see as user.
