# Morning
I'm writing this past midgnight. I need to work on my bedtime. I'm intrigued by rewriting caplearn. I relook at my old code and it's complete spaghetti. I don't understand it. I'm motivated to continue reading clean code and try to apply it to my code. I haven't been reading. 5-6pm is a good time to dedicate to reading 1 chapter. 

I notice I feel disappointed when I wake up last/late. One, I miss out on the "winner's high". Two, I know my most productive hours are in the morning. I've moved up 10pm bedtime to first goal of the day.

Besides that, I'm optimistic about the day. I know I'll get a lot done if I stay focused. When I'm feeling the pain and urge to procrastinate, I'll use these strategies:
- write a plan to get past the present difficulty
- meditate 10 minutes

That's actually a good goal to focus on: 3 redirects from the urge to procrastinate.

## Daily Goals
- 10pm bedtime 
- 3 procrastination redirects
- finish user input screen
- display search reuslts screen
- 6 hours of deep work
- read 1 chapter
- 4 deliveries


## Results
- nothing for caplearn
- 1 hour of deep work
- 4 deliveries
- 10pm bedtime


I felt the urge to procrastinate today, but I didn't respond with either planning/meditation. I need to make it happen. I can still finish the day out strong with: deliveries, reading, and bedtime.

Procrastination redirects will be my top goal.
