# Morning
I'm writing this past midgnight. I need to work on my bedtime. I'm intrigued by rewriting caplearn. I relook at my old code and it's complete spaghetti. I don't understand it. I'm motivated to continue reading clean code and try to apply it to my code. I haven't been reading. 5-6pm is a good time to dedicate to reading 1 chapter. 

## Daily Goals
- finish user input screen
- display search reuslts screen
- 6 hours of deep work
