Went through an existential day yesterday. Wasn't sure what I wanted. The 5 year
picture was unclear. It still is.

I know what I don't want:
- lazy people around me
- blindsided by chance injury
- time obligations
- unable to afford experiences:
  - 3 restaurants per week
  - 2 plane tickets per month

Amazon SWE answers but the time one.


Q: what have I learned so far with leetcode?
- data structures: linked list
- algos: binary search, merge sort
- problem-solving strategies: two pointers, divide and conquer, a bit of DP
- cut yourself off after 30 min and read the solution
