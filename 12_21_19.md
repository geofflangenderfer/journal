# Morning
## Feelings Debug
I woke up feeling discouraged and incapable, but I meditated and immediately felt relieved. For whatever reason, meditation works. 

I think the uncertainty from an unclear path to web development mastery and successful product business is causing me stress. I'd like to schedule time working on my path from current -> successful product business.

My acne is causing me stress because I'm not sure why it's happening and I don't have a plan to address it. Possible plan:
- strict 80% veg/20% meat diet, 3 day fast for a month
- strict 100% meat diet
- 3x gym/week

I keep jumping around between video series, which I think is ok. But I need to keep in mind my goal of producing a full-stack app.
