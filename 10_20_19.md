# Morning
I didn't get to bed on time last night and I ate cereal right before bed. Things to work on. I know I may not get a lot done today, but I also know that I will eventually if I'm consistent. 

## Goal Progress
**$10,000/month software development:**
- When a potential customer looks at my resume, there's no evidence I can "operate on the patient"
Q: what resume item will give a potential customer confidence I can "operate on the patient"?
- If it's a startup building a web app, having built a successful web app previously will give confidence
- vice versa for a mobile app
- social proof from previous employers
Q: what should I work on next?
- working on react would prepare me for upcoming hackathons and get me from 0 to 1 on a marketable skill. People don't pay for potential skill. I will also be developing the skill I need to start a business.
- working on android dev will differentiate me away from the mass of web developers
- working on DS/A will get me closer to big salary payday

--> web dev because I can get from 0 to 1 fastest with this. At 1, I'll be able to get a job/freelance work if necessary and I'll be working on skills to start a business. 

**$10,000 MRR software product**
- I'm getting exposure to a new potential market of food couriers
- I'm working on mobile development, which is where consumers are shifting their screen time

## Daily Goals
- finish web tutorial
- 6 hours deep work
