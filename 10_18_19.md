# Morning
I feel good today. I got up early and am ready to start the day. I'm going to be more aware today if I'm in the moment and being productive. I've got a plan of action when I recognize myself procrastinating:
- write out a plan of action
- meditate
- take a nap
- get back to work

## Daily Goals
- 1.5 kotlin tutorials
- 2 leetcode problems
- 6 hours of deep work (try to pause timer when I'm not working)
