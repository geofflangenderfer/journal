# Morning
I didn't get a good night's sleep. Hopefully, I'll get back to a better schedule after I finish up the uber eats bonus today. My new aim is for a job at FANG. In order to get there, I'm going to go for 100 leetcode problems. 

Updated Goals:
- $10,000/month from software development
  - I'll get there by getting a job at FANG
    - solve 100 leetcodes then reevaluate 
- $10,000/month MRR from a software product
  - keep my eye out for unsolved problems
  - keep iterating on my shipping ability: this needs to be faster 

## Daily Goals
- 1 leetcode problem 
- 1 video tutorial 
- 6 hours deep work
