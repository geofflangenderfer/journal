I didn't get much done yesterday, but I did sleep really well. I'm going to talk about reasoning behind those, prescriptions for improvement, and a plan for today.

## Procrastination
I let myself be distracted by crypto and twitter. That left no time for work that would move the needle. I wonder what strategies can help me flip that:
- scheduled midday meditation. If I'm procrastinating, this will interrupt that pattern. I need to make the meditation habit stick for this to work. 
- auto-block all distracting websites at certain times of day. This works great for twitter. I can maneuver around youtube, which is both distracting and helps me learn. This requires discipline to keep the filter on. 
- setup smaller smaller deadlines: my work tends to expand to fill the time available. If I shrink available time, I should get more work done. This can be part of my daily plans. Some examples:
  - marketing dashboard demo: I made small progress. When a deadline arrived, I shipped much faster. 
  - challenged to get a calculus recommendation. I needed an A by the end of the year, so I went into overdrive study mode. It worked. 
  - the mini-deadline is a challenge to get things done. It brings out the best in me.
- visualize why you're going through pain. See why your effort still makes sense.

## Good Sleep
The only things I've changed since yesterday's fantastic sleep:
- carnivore + avocado diet
- exercise before bed

## Daily Plan
- 2 hours dsa

## Recap
I got distracted today and didn't get anything I planned done. More work to do. Some ideas on why that happened:
- I got sucked into crypto twitter
- I didn't use meditation or site blocker
- I didn't visualize the pot o gold at the end of the rainbow

Off to a good start with a swim, coffee, and a brief roommate chat. Human connection makes me feel good. I'll try to keep that up. 

I've got a couple opportunities floating around in my head-short and long term. I need to triage them.

## Opportunities

    - don't need to learn spanish
  - costs
    - no income during prep. Is TA income enough?
    - must live in Mexico during (not that bad)
    - content creation is hard because of competition, but also big demand. It means I must go niche. Not sure if there's demand. How could I validate?
      - build something cool with crypto and software. Make a dope video. Look to kalle halden for inspiration.
    - grueling preparation process
      - 300 more leetcode -> 3 months
      - learn ocaml (I want to)
    - have to work in python because it's the best for timed algorithm interviews (not for Jane Street)
    - don't build reusable saas boilerplate (not if I build my own course platform (i.e. login, persistence, deployment))
  - content
    - zero to FAANG reality show: regular updates on progress
      - check out logan/jake paul. See how they're doing it. The best artists steal.

      - would need to get hired there for credibility
    - could charge $4,000 or 10% of 1st year salary ISA
- build a saas with functional programming course (elm + scala/ocaml/haskell)
    - benefits
    - credibility with paying customer makes the course more valuable
    - there's a path to $5k MRR
    - paid to build it
    - reuse ocaml skills for interview course
    - reuse boilerplate for future saas
    - excites me 
    - gets me closer to personal freedom

    - costs
    - can't think of any
    - content
    - theory: trading against retail is +EV
    - stops
    - underdogs
    - build strat that trades with retail stops. The assumption is they place them at apparent levels. You can sit just outside of them and put on profitable risk/reward reversion trades. For example, bidding at 9.75 when price is approaching 10 and putting on a stop/take profit targets of 9.5/10
    - build ROI finder that returns the highest ROI strategies
    - scan through etherscan addresses?
    - manual input with over-time automation?
    - build gas monitor that minimizes transaction costs by finding low gas times/days.          
    - should I stand pat or move?
    - how 
    - collect gas prices over time
    - identify high/low periods
    - combine the two to make efficient portfolio allocation
    - benefits
    - get to build in crypto, which I'm long-term bullish on 
    - if I find profitable strat, could lead to solo-income
    - excites me 
    - proof of work
    - It's something a non-coder could learn from
    - If you teach someone, they will respect you.
    - write in functional languages
    - big players aren't involved because of regulatory uncertainty. It would be costly to build something and have regulators shut down the industry. I could take on this regulatory risk.
    - Alameda research is a crypto arb/market-making firm
    - costs
    - no income during
    - building a trading system is a monumental endeavor
    - infrastructure: I can do it
    - research: I can do it
    - capital: maybe?
    - yearn.finance is an answer?
    - I can setup a strategy through them and raise capital through customer deposits. 2/20 arrangement.
    - coding for recruiters: learn enough code to find the diamonds in the rough.
    - include basic things
    - endorsed by peers
    - stackoverflow points
    - github stars
    - descriptive variable names
    - doesn't repeat themselves
    - has a test suite
    - README communicates clearly
    - message brianna and ask if it sounds interesting
    - benefits
    - proof of work
    - costs
    - BRR strategy in cancun
    - can I find local contractors? Gabriel does good work but he's not good at sales. 
    - how much are taxes?
    - how likely is it I can build distribution through my own website?
    - is it profitable through solely through airbnb?
    - how do property rights work?
    - can I get a mortgage?
    - how hard would it be to sell?
## Opportunities Strat
    Key questions:
    - Do I need more than spending money soon?
    - questions
    - are mom/natalie in imminent crisis?
    - how likely will I have medical expenses in the next year?
    - how does another year as a vagabond affect my relationship prospects?
    - do I see myself in the US within 5/10 years?
    - if yes, zero to jane street course
    - if not, zero to saas course
    - How important is working within crypto vs. marketing to me?
    - if important, zero to jane street
    - allows me to experiment within defi/crypto. This will lead to saas ideas as I see problems to be solved.
    - wide open for competition and growing quickly
    - marketing is old and not growing
    - apple and the privacy movment are limiting facebook's effectiveness -> I'm bearish on industry
    - if not, zero to saas
    - built in first customer and ~$400 MRR
    - lots of credibility for course
    - even if industry and course die, can reuse boiler plate for next idea
    - How likely is it I complete whole TA contract?
    - if likely, zero to jane street course (TA income)
- if not likely, zero to saas course (TA income + $2,000)

    I need to wait til first paycheck. There's uncertainty I'll collect whole contract value (see last teaching experience)

    In the meantime, I can learn ocaml. Whether dashboard or bootcamp, I'll use it to build.

    I need to give Nick ultimatum, only after reducing uncertainty around TA income: 
    - summary: This project turned out much larger than expected. It's not worth $2,000 to build this for you. It will take too long. But, if I build it as a saas and build a course, it would be. Let me build in language of choice or I walk. 
    - benefits
    - this reduces maintenance cost and dev hiring uncertainty for you
    - First year included for $2,000
    - ~$400/month subscription fee will be less than expected maintenance + hiring costs

## Daily Plan
    No internet:
    - can't grab ocaml info
    - can work on ds&a python

    Goals:
    - 4 hours ds&a
    - complete and film 3 problems

## Shopping List
    - olive oil
    - avocados
    - coffee

## Recap
    - ~2 hours of focused work 
    - wrote ~800 words 


    Despite writing for a while, I got more focused work done. There's a correlation there and I'll look to exploit it. 

    I've thought all day about what the next best move is. 

    For crypto, I can get started now on yield farming. I would need to move to an accomodating jurisdiction to arb different exchanges. Then, I would need to beat yield farming. 

    Another option is to stick everything in yield farming and focus on marketing dashboard saas. I can moonlight as a yield farmer and ds&a. 

    Either way, I need to build something that earns respect. I'll earn respect by taking people through a transformation. 




## Tweet
    I have a dilemma. I have the tools to build something respectworthy. 

    Yet, I haven't yet.

    I'm debating two paths:
    - zero to jane street (ztjs): a course that takes you from beginner to crushing a jane street software engineer interview:
                                  - zero to saas (zts): a case study course where I show how to upgrade freelance clients -> saas, including technical details.


                                                        For ztjs, I'm weighing these risks/rewards:
    - risks
- zero income between start and ramen-profitability (~3 months)
    - no credibility unless I get hired
    - I get to build on bullish industries with exciting tech:
    - crypto
    - software engineer interview prep

    For zts:
- crowded, non-growth market (marketing dashboards)
    - a paying client gives the course instant credibility. This makes it more likely to be a hit. Plus, I'll be paid $2,000 to make the saas + course


    Either way, I'll earn students' respect by helping to create:
    - jane street engineers
    - profitable saas businesses

    Impact is the only KPI

# 02-01-21
    I'm frustrated there's no internet. I could complain. The only benefit is it would add urgency. Or, I can work on ds&a, which don't require internet. I can think about haskell/scala/ocaml for the course. I can check email once a day with a nightime walk.

    I'm happy I started off well with a swim and a coffee. I enjoy getting up early. 

    I was thinking about why I'm sacrificing. Why am I in Mexico rather than the US doing some uninteresting job? Because this is more exciting than a middle-tier US living. 

    Why am I studying and working so much? I could be getting drunk and going to the beach. Because I want to be respected. I don't want to lay back in the river of life and let it carry me where it may. I want to respect myself.

    I want the capacity to help those I care about. Including myself.

    I'm optimistic about the course. Haven't decided on which, but it will give some of the respect I feel I deserve. It may also make some money.

    I'm enjoying journaling. It's almost a substitute for a conversation with a friend. It's better because I get to ask all the questions I'd like to be asked. No chance of hurting someone's feelings. Like therapy. It's worse because I'm stick stuck within my biases. I can't see what I'm missing. 

    I'm going with an ambitious goal today. I want to push myself. 

    To add accountability to mini-deadlines, I've added alarms with labels for what should be completed when it rings. This creates urgency.

    Maybe there's room for an app. In bridge, you commit to points you will score by the end of the game. You lose if you miss. For the app:
    - commit to what you'll hit by a certain time
    - on alarm ring, answer whether you've hit your target
    - at the end of the day/week/month, get a report on hit/miss rate
    - add social by sharing/competing with friends. Seeing what my friends have planned will motivate me to work harder. I won't want to be beat.
    - integrate with google calendar. Make alarm for everything listed in a day.

    I'm pretty motivated with this idea for adding urgency to my day. Let's see how today goes. If it goes well, I'll try to follow this approach for the next 9 days. I should get a lot done in that time!!!! NICE!!!!

    I like that I'm constantly checking how much time I have left and thinking about what I still have to do. It puts me in the mindframe of taking a test. Tests are stressful, but I'm completely focused and get a lot done. 

    I'm blown away by how well this alarm trick is working. I've completed all 3 leetcodes with ~1.5 hours to spare. That's awesome. Well done dude!!

    I'm doing so well, I'm gonna get ambitious. Finish all of chapter 4 today. Really nice job my man!!!

    I've laid out an ambitious end of the day. I would be so proud if I could hit it. Let's do this!

    I'm blown away by what I got done today. It's so much more than before. The blowout rate is a better indication that this method works.

## Recap
    I had a helluva day. I got much more than I expected done. A few things contributed:
    - I setup alarms
    - I followed through when I missed/hit
    - I planned/journalled
    - I had coffee
    - I swam

    It's hard to tell which was more important, but I think the alarms + journal were key. I've done the others, but yesterday was extraordinary.

    It's worth keeping this crew of things together to see if I can keep it going.

# 02-02-21
    Got in a swim already. Now waiting for daily coffee. I'm excited to build on yesterdays success. 

    I'm excited about this schedule. It will be tough, but I will be proud if I can complete it.

    I find writing soothing. With internet, I would be searching for something. This is replacing that. 

    I now have internet. I'm scared I'll get sucked into something. I'll use intention and remind myself how important staying on task is.  

    I'm feeling more anxiety today. I'm coming up against more resistance than yesterday because I'm facing new material. Reviewing is much easie than learning the first time. So I should adjust my expectations. I'll do that now.


    Having the internet on while studying is like living in a house full of brownies while on a zero sugar diet. I need to turn it off during the day and batch searches to the end of the day. I feel certain because of the vast performance difference btw today with internet and yesterday without. 

    Because of that, I'm going to have strict on/off wifi times

## Recap
    I crumbled when I faced adversity. Yesterday was smooth because I didn't face new info anxiety. As soon as I did today, my focus crumbled. I started surfing the internet. 

    Having the internet so easily accessible is like sleeping next to a syringe on a heroine detox. I need to keep it strictly off during the day and batch any searches til end/beginning of day. 

    When feeling new info anxiety, try:
    - 5 min meditation
    - 10 min walk
    - set 15 min perseverance timer



# 02-03-21

    I was so busy messing around on the internet, I didn't go to bed til 4am. I went to bed at 10:30 the previous night. 

    This along with my reduced output yesterday make me certain the internet severely affects my performance if abused. 

    How can I get the good effects while avoiding the really bad ones?:
    - defined internet use times. Make it impossible to be up at 4am on twitter/youtube
    - the problem is it's putting the syringe next to the heroine addict. Although, I may get better at abstaining over time. I'm certain I'll be tempted if I try now

    I know I will slip. The questions are:
    - will I realize when it's happening?
    - will I be able to peel myself away with various strategies?:
    - walk
    - meditation
    - visualizing my why

    It will be a continual struggle, but I commit to **doing** today. 

    How should I handled urgent internet searches?:
    - urgency test?
    - what would happen if ignored for a week?
    - clear time limit

    A lot going on made it tough to get any momentum. I'm being kind to myself today.

## Recap
    A couple things stopped me from getting in a rhythm:
    - too many calls
    - little sleep from losing track of time previous night
    - no perseverance
    - didn't visualize my why
    - didn't walk
    - didn't meditate

    Good news is there's a lot of things I can easily fix.

    - a new thing to try: don't visualize why I need to suffer through a daily study slog. Think about how cool it is I get to study interesting things all day. That is sweet.

# 02-04-21
    Mixed start to the day.
    Good:
    - swim
    - coffee
    - conversation

    Bad:
    - went to bed/got up late
    - distracted by twitter/crypto

    I'm going to be kind to myself. I'm looking forward to studying algorithms today. How cool is it I get to spend my time on this? If I string enough days together, I'll be ready to earn a high salary. 

    The batched internet searches header is great. I'm confident I won't lose the info, so I don't feel pressure to disrupt myself at this instant. I know I can come back to it at a better time. 

    I have two options:
    - slog forward
    - it would be faster if I could do it. But, I haven't made progress for a while. That deserves a new approach
    - restart without classes
    - I like this because it will be easier to add classes by starting from a working implementation

    Feeling the frustration and urge to assuage it. I'll try a walk. Feeling less stressed now. And, I have a new idea to try. Nice!

    I'm going to turn on wifi to watch a video. No need to keep banging my head against a wall. instantly fail to stay on task

    bad start to the day. I got in a swim and coffee, but haven't started working yet by 2.5pm.

    I need to build a habit where I start at the same time every day. That means I need a consistent bedtime routine. That won't happen while living with other people. Unless I get lucky to find a quiet shared room.

    All this is no longer an issue when I get a salary. My fastest path to something I'm happy with is leetcode. I have ~75 solved. I need to get to 150.

## Recap




    I'm feeling the resistance today. 

    I tried meditating and it was great practice fighting the resistance. My mind would wander, then I would come back to center.

    This process of being kind and recovering from distraction will help during normal work. I'm going to make meditation standard practice.

    Missed on heapsort impl. Felt the resistance and didn't bounce back. I didn't try any of my strategies:
    - take a walk
    - meditate
    - switc

    I guess I switched subjects, but I was distracted by crypto/twitter. I need to enforce no wifi times and be quick to meditate/walk to break out of an anxiety negative spiral.

    I'm pushing film leetcode for the day to continue working on heapsort implementation.

    I feel bad about being too harsh with Ethan. I'll look for an opportunity to apologize.
    I did this and I feel better. Is this a sign of improvement on managing fact/feeling lenses when interacting with people.

    I feel good after meditating. It's training me to reduce falling off concentration tracks. This is an essential skill for studying. 

    Having a rough go. I'm feeling anxiety spike from many previous failed attempts. It seems worthwhile skipping heapsort and coming back to it later.

    A few issues have led to my current stalemate:
    - stubbornness on giving up
    - learned anxiety for this problem: I fail to solve it, then I dread that I will fail to solve it on subsequent days

    I think I've made a breakthrough. I'll give it 40 min. today then move on.

    It's great to see rob again. He seems to be doing well. I'm happy that he's happy. 

    I'm close to being back in the US. I need to buckle down and nail 50 more leetcode's. 

    I'm letting others down when I'm not my best version. Rob was relieved to hear of my financial stability. I can see that it pained him to grow apart from a long-term friend. 

    Struggling a bit to stick to plan. Feeling the urge to keep going, but it will derail all the other tasks.


## 3 things I'm Grateful for

    Feeling good after a great start to the morning:
    - workout
    - shower
    - shit 
    - coffee
    - reading

    I'm going to push meditation to midday. 

    I'm ready to tackle algo interviews. I think best bet is to go back and forth between ctci and leetcode. I spent ~2 weeks on heapsort, but it's barely mentioned in ctci. 

    I can use ctci to allocate my time and leetcode for extra practice problems.


    I have an idea why I related with the main character in the White Tiger. He had internalized his low value status. This made acting as a servant natural to him. In a similar way, I internalized low value from my childhood. 

    The main character throws off this low-value mindframe, first, with anger. This spurs him to break out of his servant role. 

    Similarly, I used anger to break out of my low-value mindframe. It spurred me to workout. Do I still maintain internalized low-value feelings/inclinations?

    If so, how can I train myself to be rid of them? Do I want to be? How might that benefit me?

    A good start to the morning:
    - run
    - coffee
    - reading
    - chat with friends

    I'm determined to make meaningful progress today. 

    I'm learning more about how I let others down when I'm not thriving. 

    Hearing that my friends talk/think about me when I'm not around was unexpected. It shows me I've made a bigger impression than I thought. That means higher stakes for my life outcomes. Good outcomes -> greater positive outcomes on friends. Bad -> worse negatives.

    No schedule means I'm never behind. This reduces urgency. It's important that I add that daily because I get more done.

    I got more done than I expected. I was able to recall the algo I studied, which is the first step to reasoning about algos. How about space/time complexity?


    algo study strat:
    - take blank screen
    - implement algo 
    - review
    - repeat until 2nd nature


    For the next study session, use rote memorization if unable to grasp. This is a stepping stone to understanding the algo. It will allow me to work through examples by hand.


    It's disappointing to miss a problem. But, this is the improvement process. It will suck until it doesn't. I need to keep going.

    I feel I'm getting a good deal done today. I think the meditation helped increase my focus during 2nd half of day.

    Decent start to the day:
    - run
    - groceries
    - coffee
    - brief chat with friends

    I want to have a productive day today. That means thinking before-hand about how I'll handle high-anxiety moments:
    - get stumped by leetcode
    - fail to think of new ideas right away

    Strat to handle anxiety:
    - 1-5min mini-meditation
    - walk
    - pushups/pullups
    - nap
    - journal 

    A bit of trouble getting started this morning, but I'm feeling optimistic. I took a walk to break the negative cycle and just relax. It helped (could be the nicotine/caffeine?).

    I owe it to myself and those around me that rely on me for various reasons (emotional/financial support, fitness/focus role model) to be my best self. Right now, that means becoming an Amazon swe. That requires ~4h/day of leetcode.


    The anal issue fucked me up. I couldn't focus all day. Anxiety through the roof. Even if it's cancer, there's nothing I can do until next Tuesday. The best thing I can do is put it out of my head until I can go see a doctor.

    Meditated this morning, and felt good. I need to work on phone browsing habits. I'm losing too much time to it right now.

    I've made a commitment to conquer the algo interview within 3 months. To do that, I'll spend at least 4 hours/day working on it. 

    Over 3 months (89 days), that's 356 hours. I'll use that time to:
    - leetcode
    - study algorithms and data structures
    - apply to jobs

    Feeling amazing after a beautiful time with Rob. 

    I tried my best to be accommodating of his dominant personality. The question is am I sacrificing respect from him and myself?

    I don't think so. Not if I continue to push myself forward by becoming a friend he and my future self can admire.

    I'm curious if it's possible to be friends with him without drinking. Still to be determined. 

    I've committed to 356 (89*4) hours over the next 3 months. I'm going to do it.

    It's great to start off the day with meditation. 

    I'm dreading leetcoding, but it's my ticket back to the group environment I want. I saw how bad a bad group is in Austin. And, how good here in cancun. That's worth fighting tooth and nail for. Most of the time, flight has been best option. A ticket back to a good group is worth fighting for. 

    I'm 4 hours behind because I didn't study yesterday. I'll do 5 hours the next 4 days to catchup.

    I've committed to putting in time required to join a gym. I've added responsibility with Rob. I won't let him down.

    Being in Austin at the end just drained my energy. That was a result of stupid people. 

    I'm happy with my focus today. I have room to improve, but I showed progress today. When I felt like getting a dopamine hit, I breathed and continued to focus. That choice to breath kept me on task. 

    I've made a large commitment to myself and others around me. I'll do two more hours and look to improve on today's total tomorrow. 


## 3 things I'm Grateful for

    I'm proud of my effort during the day, but afternoon could use some work. I could schedule meditation for 2pm. This may shortcircuit the afternoon no focus trend (?). I'll just be aware.

    I liked no caffeine and naps today. I felt like the nap helped me reset and allow my subconscious to work on problems. 

    I need to start nailing: 
    - bed time
    - set an alarm
    - diet
    - carnivore
    - exercise 
    - signing up for gym next friday. 
    - need to nail my hours in between.

    walking visualization this morning was great. I thought about all the people around me that would benefit from me becoming my best version. I thought about how proud of myself I would be. It has me invigorated and ready to conquer the day.

    I'm worried about letting everyone down. I can avoid that by staying focused every day. Today, I will complete:
    - 5 hours study
    - 4 problems studied
    - taxes
    - disaster loan

    I have this thought that I'd like to find a nomad like me. It's worth exploring, but also unlikely.

    Things to study:
    - functools.reduce()
- collections.namedtuple()

    SOmewhat predictably, I've incurred startup costs after my midday break. It's hard to get started, easier to keep going. I need more experiments with this, but my hypothesis is avoiding startup costs will mean more time in deep work.

    I've committed to 5.5 hours today. 3.5 more. I got this.

    Saying yes to leetcode/amazon means saying no to defi. I've just burned the defi bridges. I can rebuild in 3 months time.

    Realizing I got a bit more done yesterday than I thought. The process of making flashcards helps solidify concepts. 

    I'm feeling invigorated today. I'm ready to get closer to proving my friends and family can rely on me.

    I like the no caffeine/nap strategy. I think the naps help move things subconsciously. This brings insight quicker. I also have evidence from Puerto Escondido that I can get things done.


    Be aware of distraction. When you notice it, try to to mini-meditate. And, full meditation if neeeded. 

    I'm weak with binary trees. I think I should spend more time on them. 

    Decent start to the day. Now, let's keep it rollin.

    But, I learned how important those interventions are. 

    I'm determined to do 8 hours today and 6 hours tomorrow. I'll be so proud and will feel fine paying for gym membership. 

    That zoom malfunction was embarassing. I'll make sure to have windows backup ready.

    I've lost a hell of a lot of time with operating system issues. This is useful experience for setting up servers, but am I setting up servers?

    I'm not getting as much done as a I want. It's a combination of complacency and anxiety from failing problems. I really don't like failing. It's unpleasant, but it's the only way to mastery. 

    I remember the fear/anxiety towards talking to girls. But, on the other side of that fear/rejection was mastery. 

    Pushing through is a skill, and I need to keep refining it. 

    All the things that would make me proud require an Amazon salary. Reminding myself will make the hours easier to bear. It's ridiculous to think about "bearing" studying. I could be riding around on a motorcycle selling tortillas for $3/pack. My god. Suck it up man. 

    I haven't been getting much done. I'm going to do a one week experiment where I schedule every hour of my working day, including a shutdown time. I regret not explroing my surroundings more. If the shutdown time works, it should give more time for excursions at the end of the day or for multiple days if I can get more done. I'm going to plan out my day the night before as well.

again, I got distracted in a twitter thread. I'm going for the no-wifi-til-goals-completed strategy:
- plan night before
    - decide on leetcode/epi problems to complete
- get offline docs (will iterate towards this)
- in morning, open planned problems and shut off wifi til daily goals completed

I need to stop giving up on the day if the 1st half didn't go well. There's much to be gained from salvaging some time.

## Distraction Log
4.5-5: got distracted on a twitter rabbit hole

Right now, I cannot abstain from twitter/youtube in the moment. I need to separate that decision from implementation with time. That means a no-wifi solution. This makes it impossible to procrastinate (now  I can't wait to see how I find a new way to procrastinate haha)

with space from a don't procrastinate decision, I can be successful. When distraction is a key-stroke away, it's so tough. Here's my solution:

- plan next day the night before
- download all required info 
- wifi off until daily goals completed

## Recap
Ok, tomorrow is the start of no-wifi-til-goal-completion strat. Tonight, I need to grab everything I may need because I won't have internet all day. 

## Goals
- 5 hours deep work
- 4 leetcode

# 03-11-21
Ready to start the no-wifi-til-goal-completion strategy. In between where I'm at and the impact I want to have is all the work. I need to focus daily to compound over time. Compounding isn't limited to finance. That's a good tweet.

FOrgot to download solutions. WIll turn on internet to grab them then turn it directly off.

## Recap
I'm disappointed with the work I've done this week. My short-term desire not to study is less than my long-term.

In the past, I've just had to suck it up and grit through it. I think I will need to do the same now. 

I can get everything else in line so my stress doesn't spiral out of control:
- diet
- exercise
- sleep schedule
- meditation

## Goals
- 4 hours study
- workout
- meditate
- no sugar
- 11pm bed


These things make me more resilient to stress.

I feel pressure. I'm 32. The dating pool is shrinking. I will start having to fight agist discrimination. It's imperative that I get a foothold in industry soon.

At the same time, I need to take things day by day. Hour by hour. Like tom brady. That's how you avoid getting overwhelmed. 


It's time to activate insane mode. In college, I woke up everyday at 7am. I worked out. I studied daily. I got good grades. 

I can do that again.

Feeling a bit iffy. I'm not optimistic for the days studying. How can I excite myself and my state?

Visualizing may help with this by priming my brain and showing it what's possible. 

Also, meditating should calm me down. 

Plan:
- cbt - 15 min
- meditation - 10 min
- visualization - 10 min

I'm worried about my skin. This is the worst it has been. 

## CBT
Any weird ideas I need to work through?
- The unpleasant thoughts that come in my head make me a deviant. It shows that I'm potentially harmful
- I'll never accomplish my goals. I deserve to be forgotten, in the dirt
- There's no point studying. I'm bound to fail.

## CBT

### Biased Thought
- there's no point in working hard. I have no impact on the world.

#### Cognitive Distortions

##### mental filter
I only see what's around me. There is no one I care about close to me, so it seems like I'm not having an impact. This is a distortion as evidenced by the impact on Rob in a small period of time.

##### overgeneralization

##### all or nothing thinking
I'm not having the impact I'd like to on others, but it doesn't mean I'm having zero impact.


##### fortune-telling
My past trauma conditions me to think I'll have future failure. This discourages me from working today. 

##### jumping to conclusions
I'm jumping to the conclusion no one cares about me or is inspired by me. I don't know what's in their head.

##### personalization
I assume when I'm not noticed, it's because others consider me and discard me. In reality, they probably never think of me.

felt the pain from failing a question. It created a couple urges:
- eat sweet/salty
- quick dopamine: twitter/youtube/tinder

I felt much better after eating an avocado and moving to a new environment.
The key, as pointed out in the habit book, is:
- recognize triggers and undesired actions
- replace undesired actions with something better

In this case I:
- recognized anger, adrenaline, increased heartrate
- recognized desire for sugar/salt/dopamine
- replaced these desires with avocado/environment change

I got a good start to the day:
- jog

- quick leetcode start

Feeling the pain of leetcode failure at the moment. I need to remember that this is normal, as Richard Feynman says. When you're struggling to connect the dots, you feel like a chimp. Accept that it will be that way. 



## CBT
### Biased Thought
- I'm too dumb to work at Amazon

#### Cognitive Distortions

##### mental filter
- I'm filtering out my experience solving > 100 other leetcode problems. They were easies, but mediums are built upon easies. With a few more insights, a medium becomes an easy.
##### overgeneralization


##### catastrophizing
- I'm thinking of the worst case outcome. This will be a long journey to leetcode mastery. With many more instances of feeling dumb. Then I'll crush the interview.
##### minimizing the positive
- I'm discounting previously solved problems
### Reworded Thought
- I'm struggling on mediums right now. But, I struggled with easies when I started those also. With time and practice, mediums will become simple like easies. I need to trust the process. 
## 3 things I'm Grateful for
- opportunity to be a light to friends and family
- opportunity to build a family foundation on Amazon salary. I would be a great father.
- opportunity to overcome health issues. The skin and warts stuff are scary. But, I can give myself a shot to fight them off with exercise/diet/stress-management

## Recap
I finished the first epi, but I had to look at the answer. I'm fairly confident I can solve similar problems in the future. But, I need practice and a test to confirm. I feel like this tree chapter is huge. Might be worth it to do all problems.

It would be fun to schedule 30 min/day of translating ufcespanol


Really liking no wifi

Rough go with epi today. I didn't get either answer, so I needed to check solution. 

This is an indicator I need more practice with binary trees. One strategy:
- do ~4-5 leetcode binary problems
- come back to epi problems

### Results
- 2 epi (looked at solution)
- started early
- minimal distraction. Wifi off worked very well.
- gym with time to spare
- time-blocking seems to help me get more done with the same time available
- got frustrated, recognized it, and responded constructively 2x:
    - went for a walk
    - took a nap

    - took a nap

Pretty solid day. I'll copy today's schedule for tomorrow

## CBT

### Biased Thought
- I'm unworthy of success

I have had this belief for a long time. It came about as a result of continual negative experiences in my childhood. I need to unlearn this belief. 

#### Cognitive Distortions

##### mental filter
- I'm filtering out all the good I've done: Rob, Jonah, Kennly, UT bootcamp students
- success is a byproduct of helping others. If I cannot experience success, helping others is unsustainable.
##### overgeneralization

##### catastrophizing

##### minimizing the positive
- I'm minimizing all the good I've done and hope to do.
### Reworded Thought
I may sometimes feel I don't deserve success, but I have helped people in the past. And, I have the capacity to help many more. Success will come the more people I help. 

If I cannot experience success, I also cannot help others. 

THerefore, I am worthy of success because I will/have helped many others. 

## 3 things I'm Grateful for
- opportunity to be a light to friends and family
- opportunity to build a family foundation on Amazon salary
- opportunity to overcome health issues

- meditate

It feels good to own up to my mistakes and debug why/how I can solve them.

I gained a valuable insight about my "unworthy of success" belief. I wouldn't know I had this belief unless I examined my thoughts.

This was an incredibly valuable introspective exercise.

I lost track of time. Great start to the day, but poor follow through. 

If I'm not aware of how/why I'm spending my time, I will follow the path of least resistance (twitter/youtube).

happened yet again. Damn haha. -> wifi off strategy is an answer to this unaware browsing.

If I strictly enforce no wifi periods, I don't need to worry about tangents/rabbit-holes

## Batched Internet Searches

## Recap
It was an ok day:
- great morning
- awful midday
- decent evening

Terrible midday because I fell off on too many youtube/twitter tangents. Either wifi off or a leetcode cli would really help.


Results:
- 4 leetcode (could've been 6)
- 1 epi (looked at solution)

Goals
- 5 hours study
- 3 epi
- gym

decent start to the day, but tailed off a bit:

getting back on track. Feel great after meditation. Maybe I can insert that at times I know I tend to struggle concentrating. For example, after the morning leetcode quiz. 

Also, adding urgency will make twitter/youtube more uncomfortable.

### revision
I'm feeling the anxiety as I try to start. Here's my checklist to go through when I recognize it:
- journal/feelings debug
- break problem into chunks
- meditate
- take a walk
- take a nap
- switch subjects

I'm feeling a bit anxious after failing the logic quiz. I know there's room for improvement. But, it may feel frustratingly slow in the short-term.

2-3     : epi 1
3-3.5   : solution 1
3.5-5.5 : vanderbilt OH

7-9     : UT OH
9-10    : dinner
10-11   : epi 2
11-11.5 : solution 2

#### Goal Breakdown
- get comfortable with individual functions
- get comfortable with overall logic
- implement algo

the goal breakdown totally worked! It lowered the starting friction and I quickly breezed through to implementation. 

I'm going to do that more: journal a goal breakdown/feelings debug

I fell off on journalling for a few days. I did do some meditation, which made me feel great. 

It's up to me now to buckle down for 12 hour days. 5-10 problems solved. I know I can do it.

- planning

Seems to bring out the best in me.
