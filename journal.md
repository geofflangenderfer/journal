I didn't get much done yesterday, but I did sleep really well. I'm going to talk about reasoning behind those, prescriptions for improvement, and a plan for today.

## Procrastination
I let myself be distracted by crypto and twitter. That left no time for work that would move the needle. I wonder what strategies can help me flip that:
- scheduled midday meditation. If I'm procrastinating, this will interrupt that pattern. I need to make the meditation habit stick for this to work. 
- auto-block all distracting websites at certain times of day. This works great for twitter. I can maneuver around youtube, which is both distracting and helps me learn. This requires discipline to keep the filter on. 
- setup smaller smaller deadlines: my work tends to expand to fill the time available. If I shrink available time, I should get more work done. This can be part of my daily plans. Some examples:
  - marketing dashboard demo: I made small progress. When a deadline arrived, I shipped much faster. 
  - challenged to get a calculus recommendation. I needed an A by the end of the year, so I went into overdrive study mode. It worked. 
  - the mini-deadline is a challenge to get things done. It brings out the best in me.
- visualize why you're going through pain. See why your effort still makes sense.

## Good Sleep
The only things I've changed since yesterday's fantastic sleep:
- carnivore + avocado diet
- exercise before bed

## Daily Plan
- 2 hours dsa

## Recap
I got distracted today and didn't get anything I planned done. More work to do. Some ideas on why that happened:
- I got sucked into crypto twitter
- I didn't use meditation or site blocker
- I didn't visualize the pot o gold at the end of the rainbow

Off to a good start with a swim, coffee, and a brief roommate chat. Human connection makes me feel good. I'll try to keep that up. 

I've got a couple opportunities floating around in my head-short and long term. I need to triage them.

## Opportunities

    - improve future consulting revenue
    - can afford to live in US
    - don't need to learn spanish
  - costs
    - no income during prep. Is TA income enough?
    - must live in Mexico during (not that bad)
    - content creation is hard because of competition, but also big demand. It means I must go niche. Not sure if there's demand. How could I validate?
      - build something cool with crypto and software. Make a dope video. Look to kalle halden for inspiration.
    - grueling preparation process
      - 300 more leetcode -> 3 months
      - learn ocaml (I want to)
    - have to work in python because it's the best for timed algorithm interviews (not for Jane Street)

      - would need to get hired there for credibility
      - could charge $4,000 or 10% of 1st year salary ISA
- build a saas with functional programming course (elm + scala/ocaml/haskell)
  - benefits
    - credibility with paying customer makes the course more valuable
    - there's a path to $5k MRR
    - paid to build it
    - reuse ocaml skills for interview course
    - reuse boilerplate for future saas
    - excites me 
    - gets me closer to personal freedom
  - costs
    - can't work on ds&a as much 
    - uncertainty of outcome

    - content
      - theory: trading against retail is +EV
        - stops
        - underdogs
      - build strat that trades with retail stops. The assumption is they place them at apparent levels. You can sit just outside of them and put on profitable risk/reward reversion trades. For example, bidding at 9.75 when price is approaching 10 and putting on a stop/take profit targets of 9.5/10
      - build ROI finder that returns the highest ROI strategies
        - scan through etherscan addresses?
        - manual input with over-time automation?
      - build gas monitor that minimizes transaction costs by finding low gas times/days.          
        - should I stand pat or move?
        - how 
          - collect gas prices over time
          - identify high/low periods
      - combine the two to make efficient portfolio allocation
  - benefits
    - get to build in crypto, which I'm long-term bullish on 
    - if I find profitable strat, could lead to solo-income
    - excites me 
    - proof of work
      - It's something a non-coder could learn from
      - If you teach someone, they will respect you.
    - write in functional languages
    - big players aren't involved because of regulatory uncertainty. It would be costly to build something and have regulators shut down the industry. I could take on this regulatory risk.
      - Alameda research is a crypto arb/market-making firm
  - costs
    - no income during
    - building a trading system is a monumental endeavor
      - infrastructure: I can do it
      - research: I can do it
      - capital: maybe?
        - yearn.finance is an answer?
          - I can setup a strategy through them and raise capital through customer deposits. 2/20 arrangement.
- coding for recruiters: learn enough code to find the diamonds in the rough.
  - include basic things
    - endorsed by peers
      - stackoverflow points
      - github stars
    - descriptive variable names
    - doesn't repeat themselves
    - has a test suite
    - README communicates clearly
  - message brianna and ask if it sounds interesting
  - benefits
    - proof of work
  - costs
- BRR strategy in cancun
  - can I find local contractors? Gabriel does good work but he's not good at sales. 
  - how much are taxes?
  - how likely is it I can build distribution through my own website?
  - is it profitable through solely through airbnb?
  - how do property rights work?
  - can I get a mortgage?
  - how hard would it be to sell?
## Opportunities Strat
Key questions:
  - Do I need more than spending money soon?
    - questions
      - are mom/natalie in imminent crisis?
      - how likely will I have medical expenses in the next year?
      - how does another year as a vagabond affect my relationship prospects?
        - do I see myself in the US within 5/10 years?
    - if yes, zero to jane street course
    - if not, zero to saas course
  - How important is working within crypto vs. marketing to me?
    - if important, zero to jane street
      - allows me to experiment within defi/crypto. This will lead to saas ideas as I see problems to be solved.
      - wide open for competition and growing quickly
      - marketing is old and not growing
      - apple and the privacy movment are limiting facebook's effectiveness -> I'm bearish on industry
    - if not, zero to saas
      - built in first customer and ~$400 MRR
        - lots of credibility for course
      - even if industry and course die, can reuse boiler plate for next idea
  - How likely is it I complete whole TA contract?
    - if likely, zero to jane street course (TA income)
    - if not likely, zero to saas course (TA income + $2,000)

I need to wait til first paycheck. There's uncertainty I'll collect whole contract value (see last teaching experience)

In the meantime, I can learn ocaml. Whether dashboard or bootcamp, I'll use it to build.

I need to give Nick ultimatum, only after reducing uncertainty around TA income: 
- summary: This project turned out much larger than expected. It's not worth $2,000 to build this for you. It will take too long. But, if I build it as a saas and build a course, it would be. Let me build in language of choice or I walk. 
- benefits
  - this reduces maintenance cost and dev hiring uncertainty for you
    - First year included for $2,000
    - ~$400/month subscription fee will be less than expected maintenance + hiring costs

## Daily Plan
No internet:
- can't grab ocaml info
- can work on ds&a python

Goals:
- 4 hours ds&a
- complete and film 3 problems

## Shopping List
- olive oil
- avocados
- coffee

## Recap
- ~2 hours of focused work 
- wrote ~800 words 


Despite writing for a while, I got more focused work done. There's a correlation there and I'll look to exploit it. 

I've thought all day about what the next best move is. 

For crypto, I can get started now on yield farming. I would need to move to an accomodating jurisdiction to arb different exchanges. Then, I would need to beat yield farming. 

Another option is to stick everything in yield farming and focus on marketing dashboard saas. I can moonlight as a yield farmer and ds&a. 

Either way, I need to build something that earns respect. I'll earn respect by taking people through a transformation. 




## Tweet
I have a dilemma. I have the tools to build something respectworthy. 

Yet, I haven't yet.

I'm debating two paths:
- zero to jane street (ztjs): a course that takes you from beginner to crushing a jane street software engineer interview:
- zero to saas (zts): a case study course where I show how to upgrade freelance clients -> saas, including technical details.


For ztjs, I'm weighing these risks/rewards:
- risks
  - zero income between start and ramen-profitability (~3 months)
  - no credibility unless I get hired
- I get to build on bullish industries with exciting tech:
  - crypto
  - software engineer interview prep

For zts:
- crowded, non-growth market (marketing dashboards)
- a paying client gives the course instant credibility. This makes it more likely to be a hit. Plus, I'll be paid $2,000 to make the saas + course


Either way, I'll earn students' respect by helping to create:
- jane street engineers
- profitable saas businesses

Impact is the only KPI

# 02-01-21
I'm frustrated there's no internet. I could complain. The only benefit is it would add urgency. Or, I can work on ds&a, which don't require internet. I can think about haskell/scala/ocaml for the course. I can check email once a day with a nightime walk.

I'm happy I started off well with a swim and a coffee. I enjoy getting up early. 

I was thinking about why I'm sacrificing. Why am I in Mexico rather than the US doing some uninteresting job? Because this is more exciting than a middle-tier US living. 

Why am I studying and working so much? I could be getting drunk and going to the beach. Because I want to be respected. I don't want to lay back in the river of life and let it carry me where it may. I want to respect myself.

I want the capacity to help those I care about. Including myself.

I'm optimistic about the course. Haven't decided on which, but it will give some of the respect I feel I deserve. It may also make some money.

I'm enjoying journaling. It's almost a substitute for a conversation with a friend. It's better because I get to ask all the questions I'd like to be asked. No chance of hurting someone's feelings. Like therapy. It's worse because I'm stick stuck within my biases. I can't see what I'm missing. 

I'm going with an ambitious goal today. I want to push myself. 

To add accountability to mini-deadlines, I've added alarms with labels for what should be completed when it rings. This creates urgency.

Maybe there's room for an app. In bridge, you commit to points you will score by the end of the game. You lose if you miss. For the app:
- commit to what you'll hit by a certain time
- on alarm ring, answer whether you've hit your target
- at the end of the day/week/month, get a report on hit/miss rate
- add social by sharing/competing with friends. Seeing what my friends have planned will motivate me to work harder. I won't want to be beat.
- integrate with google calendar. Make alarm for everything listed in a day.

I'm pretty motivated with this idea for adding urgency to my day. Let's see how today goes. If it goes well, I'll try to follow this approach for the next 9 days. I should get a lot done in that time!!!! NICE!!!!

I like that I'm constantly checking how much time I have left and thinking about what I still have to do. It puts me in the mindframe of taking a test. Tests are stressful, but I'm completely focused and get a lot done. 

I'm blown away by how well this alarm trick is working. I've completed all 3 leetcodes with ~1.5 hours to spare. That's awesome. Well done dude!!

I'm doing so well, I'm gonna get ambitious. Finish all of chapter 4 today. Really nice job my man!!!

I've laid out an ambitious end of the day. I would be so proud if I could hit it. Let's do this!

I'm blown away by what I got done today. It's so much more than before. The blowout rate is a better indication that this method works.

## Recap
I had a helluva day. I got much more than I expected done. A few things contributed:
- I setup alarms
  - I followed through when I missed/hit
- I planned/journalled
- I had coffee
- I swam

It's hard to tell which was more important, but I think the alarms + journal were key. I've done the others, but yesterday was extraordinary.

It's worth keeping this crew of things together to see if I can keep it going.

# 02-02-21
Got in a swim already. Now waiting for daily coffee. I'm excited to build on yesterdays success. 

I'm excited about this schedule. It will be tough, but I will be proud if I can complete it.

I find writing soothing. With internet, I would be searching for something. This is replacing that. 

I now have internet. I'm scared I'll get sucked into something. I'll use intention and remind myself how important staying on task is.  

I'm feeling more anxiety today. I'm coming up against more resistance than yesterday because I'm facing new material. Reviewing is much easie than learning the first time. So I should adjust my expectations. I'll do that now.


Having the internet on while studying is like living in a house full of brownies while on a zero sugar diet. I need to turn it off during the day and batch searches to the end of the day. I feel certain because of the vast performance difference btw today with internet and yesterday without. 

Because of that, I'm going to have strict on/off wifi times

## Recap
I crumbled when I faced adversity. Yesterday was smooth because I didn't face new info anxiety. As soon as I did today, my focus crumbled. I started surfing the internet. 

Having the internet so easily accessible is like sleeping next to a syringe on a heroine detox. I need to keep it strictly off during the day and batch any searches til end/beginning of day. 

When feeling new info anxiety, try:
- 5 min meditation
- 10 min walk
- set 15 min perseverance timer



# 02-03-21

I was so busy messing around on the internet, I didn't go to bed til 4am. I went to bed at 10:30 the previous night. 

This along with my reduced output yesterday make me certain the internet severely affects my performance if abused. 

How can I get the good effects while avoiding the really bad ones?:
- defined internet use times. Make it impossible to be up at 4am on twitter/youtube
  - the problem is it's putting the syringe next to the heroine addict. Although, I may get better at abstaining over time. I'm certain I'll be tempted if I try now

I know I will slip. The questions are:
- will I realize when it's happening?
- will I be able to peel myself away with various strategies?:
  - walk
  - meditation
  - visualizing my why

It will be a continual struggle, but I commit to **doing** today. 

How should I handled urgent internet searches?:
- urgency test?
  - what would happen if ignored for a week?
- clear time limit

A lot going on made it tough to get any momentum. I'm being kind to myself today.

## Recap
A couple things stopped me from getting in a rhythm:
- too many calls
- little sleep from losing track of time previous night
- no perseverance
  - didn't visualize my why
  - didn't walk
  - didn't meditate

Good news is there's a lot of things I can easily fix.

- a new thing to try: don't visualize why I need to suffer through a daily study slog. Think about how cool it is I get to study interesting things all day. That is sweet.

# 02-04-21
Mixed start to the day.
Good:
- swim
- coffee
- conversation

Bad:
- went to bed/got up late
- distracted by twitter/crypto

I'm going to be kind to myself. I'm looking forward to studying algorithms today. How cool is it I get to spend my time on this? If I string enough days together, I'll be ready to earn a high salary. 

The batched internet searches header is great. I'm confident I won't lose the info, so I don't feel pressure to disrupt myself at this instant. I know I can come back to it at a better time.
