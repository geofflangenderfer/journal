# Morning
## Feelings Debug
I'm feeling content. No anxiety. Ready to perform. 

I'm in no rush to get blog up and running. This journal provides most of the benefit. A blog is just marketing. There needs to be a valuable product before you can market though. I'll work on it when I have time.

I'm a bit anxious about failing to get my goal 5 hours the last few days. The best solution is to get it today.
