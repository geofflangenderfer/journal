I have a long list of frustrations. Things that make me angry. I'm going to test
anger vs. indifference. One hypothesis says I need anger to motivate me to
outperform. Another says anger is unnecessary, and I only need follow
passions/interests.

Experiment:
for each treatment:
- perform on wakeup for two weeks
- log emotions and deep work daily
compare emotions/deep work logs


What's the one thing that will have highest leverage?
- leetcode:
  - move to monterrey
  - make 1 video/day for 75 days
- reading influence
- reading how to win friends and influence people
- how to make $500 on a bike
- 30 day home transformation: How much can I improve in 30 days?
- work on selfieLog


Using a daily checklist could help me getting started in the morning
Checklist:
- start simple
- right rewards
- journal
- todo
- calendar

Reward myself after accomplishments:
- not with dopamine seeking activities: computer, phone
- with reflections on progress made, confidence gained
