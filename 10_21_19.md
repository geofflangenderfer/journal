# Morning 
I'm feeling ok, although my sleep time has been poor. I'm feeling better doing these journals. It helps to get the inner feelings out and crystallized. It brings clarity.

# Daily Results
- finished web tutorial
- got most of user-input page on the screen

I thought I did worse than actual. I hit most of my goals I set, which is a pleasant surprise. I even made decent money from tips today. I'm going to try rewarding myself by finishing up for the day when I hit my goals. Right, I fill the rest of the time inefficiently when I've hit my goals. I think this will motivate me to stay focused.
