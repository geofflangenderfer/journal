# Recap
didn't finish our hackathon project by the deadline. I got a chance to see what an experienced engineer can do. He shipped a lot more code than me. It shows me I have a way to go. I need to master my craft, which is javascript right now. 

I'm going to master javascript, then ds/algos, then kotlin
