## Feelings Debug
a bit frustrated and anxious about a late start today, but I did find a lot of useful info around building a learn-kotlin-with-tdd type project.

Feeling frustrated about continued difficulties with bedtime. 

No excuses. I'm stoppin at 6pm, then HEB, then workout, then eat, then sleep before midnight.

# Recap
I'm still struggling with bedtime. I'm going to nail wake up and get right to work. the goal tomorrow is to load all the trips into a mongodb server and think about UI/UX from driver POV:
- what will help me maximize my hourly?
- which restaurants should I wait by? Does this change when there's a promotion?
- What DOW/TOD should I work?
- Given my calendar, how should I allocate x hrs/week to maximize my hourly?
- Are there any special promotions offered recently?
- how much can I expect to make if I work X hours/month?
- how am I doing compared to my peers?
- do my peers have any advice/do they want to interact?

profit = # deliveries/hour * $ amount/delivery * hours worked
- campus has higher # deliveries/hour
- dt has much higher $ amount/delivery



views/features:
- user goes to calendar tab and picks highest $/hr blocks to work given his busy schedule
- user goes to # deliveries/hour heatmap and sees that UT campus is best. He'll keep this is mind when there's a # deliveries bonus
- user goes to $ amount/delivery heatmap and sees dt is best. He'll focus his time there unless he has a good reason to move elsewhere
- user goes to peer ranking tab and sees that he's in 90th percentile for $ earned/month and 50th for $/hr
- user goes to where did i go tab to see a replay of his work night with chronological pickups/dropoffs
- user goes to apt building tab to note an entrance code
