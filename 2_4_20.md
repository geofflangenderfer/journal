# Morning
## Feelings Debug
I'm feeling angry for being woken up in the middle of the night. Someone increased the temperature after I lowered it, after I went to bed. Probably peter. 

I'm going to talk to him:
- tell him it frustrated me to wake up in the middle of the night sweating due to the heat
- Ask that he not increase the temperature as it makes me uncomfortable and interrupts my sleep
