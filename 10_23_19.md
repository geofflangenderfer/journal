# Morning
Got a good nights sleep and went to bed on time. I'm curious to see how this affects my distraction throughout the day. I'm focusing on procrastination redirectes and finishing the search page

## Daily Goals
- 3 procrastination redirects (meditaiton, write a plan)
- get something for search view
- 1 leetcode problem
- 6 hours deep work
- 10pm bedtime 
- read 1 chapter 
- 4 deliveries

## Results
- 2 redirects
- 2 hrs deep work
- 4 deliveries

# Recap
More distracted than I'd like. The rent thing is making it hard to concentrate, although I think I have a plan to make what I need before the deadline. Working that out should reduce that as a distraction. My goal is to do 4 hours deep work in one sitting. Twice what I did today.
