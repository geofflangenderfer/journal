# Morning
I'm feeling frustrated by a variety of things: Uber shorting me for completed trips, feeling stagnant with code, investments going south. 

For uber, all I can do is make my case and consider other platforms to work on. Also, making more of an effort at English teaching. 

For code, I need to make 4 hours/day non-negotiable and move up over time. 

For investments, the risk doesn't match the potential gain to my measly 4k. I risk my well-being, my rent/food buffer that allows me to work towards a 100k/year job.I can't risk 100k/year for a measly 4k. 


## Daily Goals
- 4 hours coding
- apply to English teacher job
- write email to uber
