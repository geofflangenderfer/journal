# Morning
Days til app submission: 45
## Feelings Debug
I'm feeling good this morning after meditating and mini-yoga session. I'll try to continue that for the week to see how it goes. 

I'm feeling proud of the work I did yesterday, especially that I stayed on task for longer than I recently have been able. Let's keep it up!

I'm feeling hopeful that I can do good work to be better myself and those around me.

# Recap
I got blocked at midday and moved up my 1st meal. I still completed 2/5 hours after eating and gym, so it seems I wasn't drastically affected. 

I got a bit of bad news with gigMax. This is when I moved up my meal. I think it worked out ok because I made the key decision to continue development. 

I'm happy with what I got done. Another alternative to the meal for significant points during the day is a walk (working out?)
