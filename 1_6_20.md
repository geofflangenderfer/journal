# Morning
Days til app submission: 45
## Feelings Debug
I'm feeling good this morning after meditating and mini-yoga session. I'll try to continue that for the week to see how it goes. 

I'm feeling proud of the work I did yesterday, especially that I stayed on task for longer than I recently have been able. Let's keep it up!

I'm feeling hopeful that I can do good work to be better myself and those around me.
