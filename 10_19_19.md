# Morning
Had a rough night of sleep after stuffing myself with cereal right before bed. I slept like I was drunk: terribly. Had a crappy night of tips from work, which is ok because that sort of thing will vary. My goal is to make it to the leetcode contest tonight starting at 9:30pm, so I need to be on the bus tonight by 9pm.

## Schedule
- 7:30am-4pm android/leetcode
- 4pm eat
- 5pm-9pm work
- 9:30pm leetcode contest

## Daily Goals
- 1 leetcode problem
- 1/2 a kotlin tutorial vid
- 6 hours deep work by 4pm
