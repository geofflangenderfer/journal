I'm feeling great after learning about a coding project contest. I'm filled with optimism right now, but I need to come up with a plan broken down to daily activities that will lead to success.
# Goals

- finished app design, but didn't break down into daily routine
# Recap
I stayed up really late, which led to a late start to the following day. I need to focus on my choice of when to go to sleep. I need to quit eating before bed.
