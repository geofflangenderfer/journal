I'm in a rut. Having an existential crisis. Software knowledge isn't enough. I
need to know how to sell.

Q: what cool software thing could I build and document, aiming to grow an
audience?
- selfieLog
- coach gigMax
-

Q: how will I reward myself after realizing goals?
- relish a small step to getting better.
- Think on where I'll be after stacking them.
- If I can do it once I can do it again
