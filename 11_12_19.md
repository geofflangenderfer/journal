# Morning
I got a late start today. My sleep schedule and eating are off. I'm feeling less anxiety and uncertainty after planning out a mini-set of goals leading up to my birthday in a month or so. I've come up with a daily/weekly system to follow that shold help me land a job by my birthday

## Daily Goals
- 1 chapter EloquentJS
- todoDone app: I want some objective data on my expected and actual daily output
  - asks what your daily goals are in the morning
  - asks what you accomplished at end of day
- todoDone frontend

## Weekly Goals
- 5 EJS chapters
- publish mini-tutorial

## Results
- nothing

# Recap
I chose to procrastinate multiple times. I ate poorly. I went to bed at a horrible time.
