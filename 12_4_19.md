# Morning
Got a slower start than I wanted. Was distracted by my phone. Will make an effort to hop right into meditation and skip phone in mornings. Feeling good about the day. I can win the day, which is the elementary building block for all my goals. Each day builds upon the previous. 

# Daily Goals
- 6 hours coding
- 1 chapter eloquent javascript
- flashcards for interview next week
- 1 hour working on bike

# Goals Completed
- 4 hours coding 
- 1/3 EJS problem

# Recap
I got distracted and wasn't able to get back on track today. Some strategies to try when I recognize falling off-balance:
- take a walk
- switch tasks and work on something else
- meditate 10-20min

I'm going to try all three.
