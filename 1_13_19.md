## Feelings Debug
I'm feeling good after listening to music, it definitely positively affects my mood. 

feeling anxious about a long string of slow starts to mornings and late bedtimes. I need to exercise regularly to nail the bedtimes. 

feeling anxious about lagging progress with algos/ds practice. If I finish app, but not algo/ds, it would be ok but not great.
