# Morning
## Feelings Debug
feeling good about getting started with the blog, but I'm realizing it's going to take a bit of work to get up and running. I need to be patient as I work on it. 

yesterday I didn't stay as focused as I'd like. Ideally, I'd like to focus on something, then take a break when I reach something difficult. Not youtube, or anything else.
