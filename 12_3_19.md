# Morning
got a good nights sleep, but overslept my alarm. Going to adapt and continue on with the days goals. I suspect I will have to do this often and for various reasons. Good practice. Still motivated to knock out these goals, as they put me on the right path. 

# Daily Goals
- meditation
- 10 SQL codewars problems
- 10 hours coding 
- pay rent/cc
- setup google sheets to track natalies goals
- bed by midnight
