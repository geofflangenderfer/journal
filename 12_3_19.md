# Morning
got a good nights sleep, but overslept my alarm. Going to adapt and continue on with the days goals. I suspect I will have to do this often and for various reasons. Good practice. Still motivated to knock out these goals, as they put me on the right path. 

# Daily Goals
- meditation
- 10 SQL codewars problems
- 10 hours coding 
- pay rent/cc
- setup google sheets to track natalies goals
- bed by midnight


# Goals Completed
- meditation
- 7 SQL codewars problems
- 6.3 hours coding 
- pay rent/cc
- setup google sheets to track natalies goals
- bed by midnight

# Recap
I got close with my goals, but not all the way. I also got all questions right on coding take home, so there's that. I'm liking the results for planning out my day. Let's see if I can keep it up.
