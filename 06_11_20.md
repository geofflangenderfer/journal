I'm anxious about my 100hr week. Not because it's too much, because I'm
indifferent.

Let me remind myself of my why and my vision. In 5 years:
- I'm living in my own place
- Have a loving, pregnant girlfriend
- My time at amazon gave me seed capital and credibility to start my own
  company. It's doing great and is resilient to natural events.
