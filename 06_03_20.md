I'm certain social media is deleterious to my concentration. I'm unable to get
anything else done. I'll strive towards being unaffected. That's a long-term
goal. For now, I'm shutting it off completely.

I'm not going to be ready a week for the amazon interview. I can postpone
another month and work on a crypto arb bot. I'll push that decision and focus on
leetcode.
