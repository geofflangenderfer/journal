It feels like I'm consuming more than I should be. I spent all day yesterday on
social media. It has a few downsides:
- it reduces my attention span
- it takes away from creation time

I need to actively reduce time spent on it.

My laissez-faire approach to algo studying has not worked. I'm going to
experiment with forced time studying. I will turn off the following until 5
hours deep work finished:
- cell wifi
- all entertainment websites

I will spend my time either:
- working on problems
- learning about ds/algos
- walking
