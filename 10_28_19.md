# Recap
I'm writing this the next day. I didn't get anythin done. Worried about short-term money situation. The answers I've considered are uber (beats up my body and dangerous), server (shitty hours and not developing any valuable skills), and upwork (low pay and high competition mean I would need to move to Mexico)
